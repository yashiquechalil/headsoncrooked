Mushroomification: Legs, Legs, Legs follows the unlikely (and explosive)  collision between a man and a mushroom. In one place, there is a mushroom, deep within the forest, raging against the oppressive mycelial hive mind that it has been born to serve and desperate to create a body of its own so that it might escape. In another, a scientist by the name of Karies is working in secret on developing a human hive-mind with the hopes of saving the world - which in Karies’ mind, means making everyone more like him.
 
The play explores themes of belonging, loneliness, and what it means to be your own person in a weird slice of history that’s constantly telling us what we should and shouldn’t be. In one world, this might be a story of two lovers finding each other, in another it might be gory body horror. In this world, it sits somewhere in the middle.
