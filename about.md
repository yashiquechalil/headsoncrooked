Heads on Crooked is an international collective of multi-disciplinary theatre-makers based in Edinburgh. We’re passionate about developing and stretching the possibilities of avant-garde theatre at a time where the theatre industry is more averse to dramaturgical risk than it has ever been. There’s so much urgency, joy, and creative potential missing from mainstream theatre at the moment, and we want to prove to all audiences (especially the sceptical ones) that experimental theatre can be an act of laughter and community. This is our remedy to every time we’ve been bored as hell by the end of the first act.
 
With a team made up of members from all over the world, we offer unique perspectives on methods of storytelling missing from or under-represented by Scotland’s cultural scene. We want to create a space where audiences can access unique, challenging art without feeling alienated, and to invite the world to come and laugh with us, gasp, cry, and shout with us, and build community with us.
 
Most importantly, we believe the art is the thing. We believe in people. We believe in peeking through the letterbox, kicking down the door, and smashing the windows of creative and bureaucratic boundaries. And, most of all, we believe in crooked heads.
